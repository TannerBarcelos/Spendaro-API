## Docs

This is the official documentation for the Spendaro REST API. Here you can find design docs, tutorials, and other resources to help you get started with the API.

Eventually this will be hosted alongside the docs for the project itself at [docs.spendaro.com](https://docs.spendaro.com).

> **Note**: The domain is not yet active.
